A Truth and Dare Bot made by @UnknownDeveloper and Ezio
To get started I took a publicly available bot and snipped it down to like 10 lines. The bot functionality in short.
Then I made a developer account, Test-Discord-Server and at the moment I can run the bot locally and it sits in the chat as a person on my Test-server.
However it doesn not run outsourced on a server yet.
Here is the basic instruction of the bot that I started with:

#How to run
1. Make a new discord app at: discordapp.com/developers/applications/me
2. Get the token and Client / Application ID and write it down
3. Download the files
4. Install node.js libraries: ` discord.js, open,  ` 
7. and run it in the terminal or CMD with
 ` node runbot.js `
You will see a webpage when it's succesfull telling you information about the bot
8. The bot will be turned on and you have to add it on the server by doing this `https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=*CLIENT/APPLICATION ID*&scope=bot `
9. When bot is added to find the client id is type \ before mentioning the username and you'll get the id
10. Replace the id's with the one's in the runbot.js
